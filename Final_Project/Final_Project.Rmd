# Bacterial-Fungal Interactions in Mangrove Roots 

## Introduction

This project aims to illuminate potential interactions between bacterial and fungal species in terms of community assembly. The analysis is multi-faceted and will include various comparisons between the subjects of research.

# Example data analysis

## Mushroom growth data

Here, we are looking at growth rates for two species of commercial mushrooms: *Pleurotus ostreotus* and *P. cornucopiae*.

Let's take a quick look at the data structure:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("../data/mushroom_growth.csv")

kableExtra::kable(df[1:5, ]) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_classic()
```

We have a few variables that were measured, and the outcome of growth rate is in g/day. The independent variables were...

```{r}

names(df[1:5,])
```

Okay, let's take a look at this data graphically:

```{r, fig.width=8,fig.height=6}
library(GGally)
ggpairs(df)
```

The purpose of this data set was to find the combination of inputs that led the fastest mushroom growth for sale at the farmers' market. 


Let's look at that.

Here are the conditions where the max growth rate was found:

```{r}

df %>% 
  filter(GrowthRate == max(GrowthRate)) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_classic()

max(df$GrowthRate)
```

### Well, which factors are really important for mushroom growth rate?

Here's a simple model and a list of significant predictors:

```{r}
mod <- glm(data=df,
           formula = GrowthRate ~ Light + Species + Nitrogen + Humidity + Temperature)
mod$formula
summary(mod) 
mod %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  filter(p.value < 0.05) %>% 
  kableExtra::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_classic()

```

### A reduced model, provided by the MASS::StepAIC() function gives us the following model:

```{r}
step <- mod %>% 
  MASS::stepAIC()
step$formula

mod2 <- glm(data=df, formula = step$formula)

mod2 %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable() %>% 
  kableExtra::kable_classic()

```

And now, since it's a final project, Dr. Zahn wants many pretty pictures:

```{r}
library(modelr)

p <- add_predictions(df, mod2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Light, y=pred, color=Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title= "Predicted growth rates from second model")

plotly::ggplotly(p)

```
